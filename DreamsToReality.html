            <p>How many of you have a dream or have a passion project that you want to pursue? All of you, right? Great! So, when we have a dream, we all want 
              to make it a reality but now there comes a huge problem. In most of the cases, we find ourselves stuck in a situation when we think that we can’t 
              achieve the dream. We’re not good enough or the friends of yours are talking about you or the people are talking behind you back. You don’t have that 
              opportunity, you don’t have all these resources, right? But let me tell you one simple thing, the biggest obstacle or the hindrance from your dream to 
              reality is you. But there might be a situation where you can ask yourself that I don’t have the resources. 
              <br>
              So today I want to talk about a very small framework that helped me. I believe in this particular scenario, when we start working with our dreams, a lot
              of people thinks of getting rid of their dreams. 
              Now here is a very small framework like dreams to goals to plans to reality.
              </p>
              <br>

               <h2 class="mb-3">GOAL</h2>
               <p>Let me tell you how it works. In very simple terms, when you have a dream and you write it down, it becomes a goal. What you need are a number 
                 and a date. For example, I want to revolutionize the banking system by using technology. It’s a dream, it’s not a goal. When I say, I want to 
                 reduce the fraud in the online purchase by 50% by the end of this year,2020, it becomes a goal. You have a date; you have a number and you write 
                 it down. And a very interesting scale study that has been done in Harvard MBA students, shows that only 3% among all of us write down their goals 
                 and after 20 years, they have found that those 3% were earning more than the rest 97%. And that’s the very first step that we need to take. It’s very 
                 simple but I think the majority of us, haven’t done that.  
                 Now the problem is when you write down your goals there are many issues, you might be thinking that you can’t achieve, you might be thinking that 
                 you are not good enough, you might be thinking that the dream is too big. But for you to write it down, nothing is a hindrance apart from you. Do 
                 you get it? 
                 A very prominent TED speaker Mr Tony Robbins once said, ‘If you don’t have the resources it’s your problem that you’re not resourceful enough.’ 
                 So, let’s not complain and let’s see how can get rid of that thing.
               </p>
               <br>

               <h2 class="mb-3">PLAN</h2>
                  <p>Now here comes the next problem, when you have a goal, you might be thinking that how do you do it, it’s a goal, it’s not a plan. Then what you
                  need to do is to write down a plan. The problem is we overestimate our memory to a huge extent. We feel like I have a plan and I’ll remember that 
                  after two days. But the problem of motivation is motivation starts you going, it just starts you. It doesn’t keep you going. Now that’s where the 
                  plan comes in. As we say, motivation starts you and discipline keeps you going. But if you don’t have a plan, you can’t be disciplined. So right 
                  now, you all need to have a plan. I know that it’s not possible to come out with a plan within 20/30 seconds, it might take a day or two. Now here 
                  you need to find out what’s holding you back? Why aren’t you being able to write down your plans? Don’t you have the right expertise? Figure that out.
                  Don’t you have the mentors? Don’t you have the money? Don’t you have the partnership? Don’t you have the peer support? 
                  What exact thing that is required that you don’t have. Figure that out. Why? Because only then it becomes a plan.  
                  </p>
                  <br>

               <h2 class="mb-3">Reality</h2>
                  <p>
                    Now, after you have a plan, you have to put in the effort, then it becomes a reality. Most of the people fall apart in this particular segment, 
                    we have our plans ready, but the problem is, we don’t want to wake up early, right? We don’t feel like studying, we don’t feel like going to the 
                    next meeting, we’re not just feeling productive today. Right? What to do?  
                  </p>
                  <br>

               <h2 class="mb-3">IN A NUTSHELL</h2>
                <p>
                  Now to put it up in a very interesting nutshell, you have a dream, you write it down, it becomes a goal, we already did that, right? Very good. 
                  After going home tonight, till you have the motivation, you create a plan on how to get that goal to reality. After you have a plan, see that every 
                  morning so that it reminds you every single morning that you have a task to complete. And after you have that, figure out what are the things that are 
                  holding you back every single day. Many of the people might be shy, but they probably want to be a teacher. Now because of that shyness, you don’t want
                  to be a teacher. Break that boredom, break that shyness. If you don’t create that framework, you’ll be left with nothing, you won’t be pursuing a 
                  single dream of yourself. It will be hiding in there within your shell of nervousness and uncertainty. And you have that recipe in yourself, right? 
                  This dream is not going to come into reality, let me just get rid of that and go into a place that’s probably more comfortable. I want to mention one 
                  more quote, which is close to me and actually, it hit me very hard. It said, ‘Most people die at 21, but they don’t get buried till 75.’ It means, when 
                  you are 75, you burn all your dreams, passions, aspirations and everything that you have. Why? Because you probably think it’s not going to work out, and
                   you opt for a job that you don’t like, you work for a boss probably want to beat him every single day. And for the rest of your life, you continue the 
                   life you never wanted to pursue. What it means is when you buy it on your dreams, you die. AT 21, when you graduate you die. And the rest of your life 
                   it’s a dead man’s life. At 75, you just buried but you died back in 21. 
                   <br>
                   So always, always have a plan. It’s very simple. You have a dream, plan it out, now you have a goal. And then you create a plan and then it becomes a
                   reality. So, I hope this very simple framework would help you to make your dreams into realities. It doesn’t matter how big of it or how small of it, 
                   concentrate on it and don’t, please never let the people define what your next life is going to be. And please, don’t die at 21, leave the rest of the 
                   life to have an amazing story to tell someday in front of an amazing crowd. Thank you so very much!
